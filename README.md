# Next.js 15 Client-Side Navigation Error: ReferenceError

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications that occurs during client-side navigation.  The error is a `ReferenceError` caused by referencing an undeclared variable within a component.

## Problem

A Next.js application using client-side navigation might throw a `ReferenceError` if a component accessed during navigation contains a reference to an undeclared variable. This often happens when the variable isn't properly defined, imported, or initialized.

This issue is particularly problematic because it only manifests when navigating to a specific route, making debugging more challenging.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the component's code to identify and correct the undeclared variable.  This may involve adding the necessary variable declaration, importing the required module, or correcting a typographical error in the variable name.

This repository provides example code showcasing the error and its resolution.  The solution file demonstrates the corrected version of the component.
